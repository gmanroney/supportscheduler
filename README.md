[Summary]
-------
Design and build the “Support Wheel of Fate”

Background
----------
At one of our companies, all engineers take it in turns to support the business for half a day at a time. This is affectionately known as BAU. Currently, there is no tool which decides who is doing BAU and when, all rotas are created and maintained by hand.

Task
----
Your task is to design and build an online “Support Wheel of Fate”. This should select two engineers at random to both complete a half day of support each. For the purposes of this task, you are free to assume that we have 10 engineers.

Business Rules
--------------
There are some rules and these are liable to change in the future:
* An engineer can do at most one half day shift in a day.
* An engineer cannot have half day shifts on consecutive days.
* Each engineer should have completed one whole day of support in any 2 week period.

Deliverables
------------
At the end of the task, the following must be included:
* A Presentation Layer (Front End)
* An API
It is also important that you document your decisions as you will be expected to talk through your approach.
